# Pricing App Updater
This is designed to be extremely lightweight and simple to use.   
## What does it Do?
1. This will kill the current pricing app,  
2. Move the downloaded pricing app to the existing location,  
3. Then start the new pricing app.  
>This does not download the pricing app, it is assumed that the pricing app is already downloaded.
## Usage
```bash
updater.exe <path to pricing app> <path to pricing app updater>
```
## Example
```bash
updater.exe "C:\Program Files\Mardens\Pricing App\pricing_app.exe" "C:\Users\user\tmp\mardens\updater.exe"
```
